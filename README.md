# bivouac - a light-weight, wsgi-compliant MVC web framework in Python

bivouac has grown out of my own efforts to build websites in Python with as thin a footprint as I can.  bivouac provides a basic MVC framework inspired by Microsoft's MVC 1.0 framework.  Expect further ruminations on the topic elsewhere.  In the past I suggested I would not support this project, but as I find I rely on bivouac for more of my own websites, I expect to do as much as I can to encourage adoption and support. I think we're on to something good here!

bivouac is WSGI compliant and aims to be as webserver-agnostic as it can.  Using mod_wsgi or isapi_wsgi, bivouac works well with both Apache and IIS, with NGINX being an untested likelihood.

Today bivouac supports authentication and user sessions using MongoDB.  Long-term look for this to become more database independent.

Currently, bivouac has a small number of dependencies:
* mod_wsgi or isapi_wsgi
* Paste & Webob
* mongodb
* PyMongo
